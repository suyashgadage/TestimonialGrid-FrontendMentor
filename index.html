                  I received a job offer mid-course, and the
                  subjects I learned were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I
                  honestly feel I got every penny‚Äôs worth.

                  ‚Äú I was an EMT for many years
                    before I joined the bootcamp. I‚Äôve been looking to make a transition and
                    have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for
                    the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly
                    thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my
                    life. Since completing the course, I‚Äôve successfully switched careers,
                    working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ‚Äù

                Awesome teaching support from TAs who did
    the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and learning from their

    to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable junior
    developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal
    attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing people.

                ‚Äú Before joining the bootcamp, I‚Äôve never written a line of
    code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
    programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of
    theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire
    curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never
    had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was
    outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial
    could ever have. In fact, I‚Äôve often referred to it during interviews as an
    example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a
    full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ‚Äù
